          You must follow any policies made available to you within the
          Services. Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with
          our Services or try to access them using a method other than the
          interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our
          Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and
          re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop
          providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or
          policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. Using our
          Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
          rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use
          content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner
          or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the
          right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don't remove,
          obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our
          Services.

          When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through
          our Services, you give Front (and those we work with) a worldwide
          license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative
          works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other
          changes we make so that your content works better with our Services),
          communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and
          distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for
          the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our
          Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you
          stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have
          added to Front Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and
          remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some
          of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of
          our use of the content submitted in those Services

          Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or
          product requirements (including age requirements) may apply.
          Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and
          those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you
          use.
